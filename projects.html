        <h1 id="augmented-reality" class="mt-4 mb-4">Augmented Reality</h1>
        <p>Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that renders computer-generated images, sounds, or other sensory
          enhancements onto a user's view of the real world. It is often achieved through the use of a device such as a
          smartphone, tablet, or specialized headset that displays the augmented reality content. </p>
        <p> AR can be used in a variety of ways, such as to provide information or assistance in real-time, to enhance
          entertainment experiences, or to facilitate communication and collaboration. For example, a person using an AR
          app on their smartphone might see virtual labels or graphics overlaid on physical objects in the real world,
          or might be able to interact with virtual objects that appear to be in the same physical space as the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          AR technology has the potential to revolutionize many industries, including education, gaming, and healthcare,
          by making it possible to access and interact with digital content in a more natural and immersive way.</p>

              <p>Worked with Professor Robert Dempski in summer 2020, we developed a HoloLens AR application for
                training students to assemble components in order. HoloLens AR enables the user to watch the tutorial
                while working on the real-life components at the same time.
                We worked as a team of 6, spending 2 months to make this application.

              <p>
                Using mixed reality in chemistry laboratory settings is a perfect fit because you can get access to
                both virtual content and real-life at the same time. Head-mounted AR serves as an additional
                information source to the researcher, which doesn’t affect his/her ability in observing real-life
                events. This is crucial especially for chemistry laboratories because if the researcher’s attention is
                fully attracted by an electronic device, it might cause safety issues.

              <p>The overall objective of this research is to develop an Augmented Reality (AR) assisted learning tool
                with educators and students involved in the design. Balancing between informative and engaging, the AR
                tool is aiming to become both engaging and helpful in terms of enhancing high cognitive level learning
                outcomes. Applying AR in education in an interdisciplinary research area including pedagogy, learning
                science, interactive media, and psychology. This study follows a participatory research approach and
                includes educational technology engineers, educators, and students to co-create an AR tool iteratively –
                engineers come up with a prototype, educators give critical feedback, and students evaluate the tool
                from both engagement and learning outcomes aspects. The study will bring insights into how to utilize
                participatory design in AR educational tools and how AR has an impact on students learning outcomes, as
                well as effective ways of prototyping AR experiences.

        <p>Virtual reality (VR) is a simulation of a three-dimensional environment that can be
          interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using specialized equipment, such as a headset
          with a screen or screens inside. VR immerses the user in a simulated experience that can include sight, sound,
          and other sensations.</p>
        <p> In VR, the user is completely immersed in a simulated environment, while in AR, the user can still see and
          interact with the real world while also seeing and interacting with virtual content.

                to 12-year-old age range. They have a range of movement capabilities but all gameplay is to be seated
                and have periods of rest built-in. The goal is to encourage the children to participate in clinical

              <p>WheelUp is a collaborative research project between Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and
                University of Massachusetts Lowell. The overall objective of the study is to co-design a high-fidelity
                VR wheelchair simulator for diverse body. It uses participatory design to engage local communities with
                alternate-abilities for the development of a wheelchair training simulator with multimodal input
                interfaces for wheelchair guidance and control. Simulated and virtual reality (VR) training allows users
                to practice difficult or stressful tasks in a safe environment. The virtual environment will integrate
                joystick, muscle signals (EMG), and eye gaze (EOG). Aesthetic attributes of the simulator such as color,
                texture, and layout will be considered to enhance the overall visual experience, making the user
                experience more enjoyable and appealing. The simulated environment includes standardized hospital or
                home; variable environments with changing obstacles such as shopping centers or workplaces. (PI: Prof.

        <h1 id="novel-interfaces" class="mt-4 mb-4">Novel Interfaces</h1>
        <p>Novel interfaces have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers and technology.</p>
        <p>EMG is a method of measuring the electrical activity of muscles, and it can be used to control prosthetics or
          other devices through muscle signals. This can be particularly useful for people with physical disabilities,
          allowing them to perform tasks that would otherwise be difficult or impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          BCI, on the other hand, involves using brain activity to control devices or machines. This has the potential
          to allow people with severe physical impairments to communicate and interact with the world around them in
          ways that were previously unimaginable. BCI technology is still in the early stages of development, but it
          holds great promise for the future.

              <p>we explore the use of brain-computer interface (BCI)-adapted visual effects to support atmosphere in a
                walking simulator, and investigate its impact on player-reported immersive experience. While players
                were using a keyboard or joystick controller to control the basic movement of a character, their mental
                state was accessed by a non-invasive BCI technique called functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
                to implicitly adjust the visual effects. Specifically, when less brain activity is detected, the
                players' in-game vision becomes blurry and distorted, recreating the impression of losing focus.
                fNIRS measures blood oxygenation levels, are related to brain activation. When a particular area of the
                brain is activated, it receives an increase in blood flow. With this biological indication, we designed
                a BCI-controlled game, in which the vision becomes blurry and distorted when less brain activity is
                detected, recreating the impression of losing focus.To analyze the player’s experience, we conducted a
                within-subjects study where participants played both a BCI-controlled and non-BCI-controlled game and
                completed a questionnaire after each session. We then conducted a semi-structured interview to
                investigate player perceptions of the impact the BCI had on their experiences. The results showed that
                players had slightly improved immersion in the BCI-adaptive game, with the temporal dissociation score
                significantly different. Players also reported the BCI-adaptive visual effects are realistic and
                natural, and they enjoyed using BCI as a supplemental control.

                We did a live coding performance using visuals and audio integrated Brain-Computer
                Interface input. We asked for a volunteer (audience or co-performer) to wear the BCI

                visuals for our performance.</p>

                We followed the approach of performance-led research in-the-wild, which falls under the broad
                umbrella of Research through Design. This means research findings are emerging from reflection on the
                making of specific interactive artifacts. Being performance-led means the practice is led by artists,
                who follow an artistic process and deliver a professional artistic product, in our case, a live coding
                performance. Being in-the-wild means the artistic product is experienced by public audiences, in our
                case, being under critical judgment by the live coding cohort. The approach involves documenting both
                the artist’s reflection on producing the work and the audiences’ experience of it.

              <p>Immersive experience pulls a viewer into another real or imagined world, enabling
                them to manipulate and interact with their environment. It has a long history, from Panoroma
                landscape painting to Cinerama widescreen projection process, to Cave Automatic Virtual
                Environment where projectors are directed to walls of a room-sized cube. While the comtemporary
                screen media erode, if not erase, viewer's perceptual differentiations between the actual
                reality and the virual reality, the gap between real and virtual is where designers perform
                their the magic touch.</p>
              <p>The market of projection mapping, IR camera touch screens, and sensor-driven
                interactions is open - the entry cost is relatively low comparing to VR/AR hardware research.
                The future lies in designing a meaningful and aesthetic experience. Level 99
                Entertainment combines escape rooms, small "challenges", and arena games with microcontrollers
                and sensors, making the traditional plays into self-reset "smart" games. TeamLab brings artists,
                programmers, CG animators, mathematicians and architects together to navigate the confluence of
                art, science, technology, and the natural world. The list of examples can go on. </p>

              <p> <em>Collection </em> is an experiment combining non-linear storytelling and traditional origami. It
                appears as an opened package, with a letter and a treasure box inside. The treasure box contains old
                pieces of newspaper clips, lab notes, drawings, and segments of a diary, forming a bizarre tragedy about
                the Werners.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is up to you to decide how to explore the Werners’ story. There are 16 pockets on the top, but more
                are hidden underneath them. It is a tangible physical book that you can even tear apart. Search through
                the pieces in the Collection to discover the truth.

              <p>This treasure box format is similar to the take-home escape room adventures. Instead of having multiple
                physical objects, you have only one complex object. However, it also limits the format of story segments
                to be paper-based.

              <p>Origami and tangible interface provide the enjoyment and engagement while exploring the puzzle.</p>

        <p>Game can be designed to achieve a specific educational or training goal, rather than purely for
          entertainment. Serious game is a type of game that is specifically designed to support learning and teaching.
          These games can be used in a variety of settings, including the classroom, after-school programs, and
          homeschooling. They can be used to teach a wide range of subjects, including math, science, reading, and
          social studies. Like serious games, games for education are often designed to be more educational in nature
          than traditional video games. However, they may still incorporate elements of entertainment and enjoyment to
          keep learners engaged.</p>
        <p>
          Game culture studies is a field of study that investigates the cultural, social, and psychological aspects of
          video games and gaming culture. Video games are an increasingly significant
          part of contemporary culture, and understanding the cultural, social, and psychological impacts of games is
          important for understanding the ways in which they shape and are shaped by society. Video games have
          the potential to be used as a tool for learning, education, and social change, and game culture studies can
          help us understand how games can be used effectively in these contexts. Video games are a rapidly
          evolving medium, and game culture studies helps us understand the ways in which games are changing and how
          they might continue to evolve in the future.

              <p>Fighting Against Coronavirus game is a single-player strategy game. The player takes the role of a
                government official in “City W” starting from January 1, 2020. The player’s mission is to guide local
                disease prevention and control work, as well as take care of the people at the epicenter of the ongoing
                outbreak with minimal loss in human life and economic growth. We worked as a team of 3, spending 4
                months to make this game.

                I designed the in-game epidemic model by modifying the SEIR model (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and
                Recovered), which makes me think of the close connection between mathematical modeling, system dynamics
                and game. Later I learned Machinations framework from the book <em>Game Mechanics Advanced Game
                  Design</em>, and it is similar to the stock and flow diagram, which confirms the close connection
                between in-game economic system and system dynamic.

              <p> The importation of western games and gaming culture have influenced China, while localization and
                creativity of its derivative games form a unique new trend. Murder mystery games, also known as “script
                killing”, is an ideal object for studying the adaptation of the games across cultures. Digitally,
                players tend to use mobile applications to hold murder mystery games virtually, and structured gameplay
                rules are set within the application and modified as needed by writers. In-person murder mystery games
                create a new market for renting and hosting the game, and under this circumstance, a combination of
                escape room and live-action murder mystery game is born. Recently, Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture
                and Tourism issued the "Regulations of Shanghai Municipality on the Filing Management of the Content of
                Escape Room and Script Killing (Draft for comments)", which states that the plots should exclude any
                information that endangers national unity and national security (Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture
                and Tourism, 2021), suggesting the media and authorities have been highly critical of the industry—a
                bottom-up game industry that developed outside of regular regulation. In this presentation, speaker 2
                considers what is distinctly “Chinese” in these game (Liu, 2014), looking specifically at in-game
                environments, external environments, and users in determining localization (Zhou & Kolko, 2005). While
                Chinese authors create more domestic stories, they also create new themes, gameplay, market, and
                regulations. Domestically, themes take the advantage of cultural background and Chinese history (Pai,
                2021). Yet even here, government policy needs to be taken into consideration.
